# multi-paste

An [Atom](https://atom.io) package that enhances Atoms pasting operations in combination with multiple selections. This was inspired by the [Text Pastry plugin for Sublime Text](https://github.com/duydao/Text-Pastry).

## Features
* Paste a range of numbers into multiple selections
  * 0 to X
  * 1 to X
  * Paste custom range of the form: **start_value step_value**

There was already a [Text Pastry package](https://atom.io/packages/text-pastry) for Atom, but it was implemented on an old Atom version and seemed discontinued. So i started my own.
